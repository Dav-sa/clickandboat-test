Click&Boat - Test at home
---

## Context

Click&Boat sends automated emails to its owners and tenants. It is the AutomaticEmailManager class that takes care of replacing the placeholders of the email templates by the context values.

This class was created a long time ago and has evolved a lot over the years. It has accumulated many bad practices and is difficult to understand and evolve.

Today we want to make a clean up of this class to make it understandable and evolutive.

## Rules

- You have to modify the project sources to :
  - Eliminate bad practices
  - Make the AutomaticEmailManager class understandable and easier to evolve
- You can modify everything except the places where the PHPDoc specifies that you should not modify a certain part of the code
- The indicative time to solve is about one hour but it is possible that you finish in more or less time. Take the time you think is appropriate.

## Deliverable

You need to version this project on Gitlab.
- The project must contain the various commits of your development, allowing us to understand your logic of task distribution.
- The visibility of the project must be private and you must have access to the following user for review:
  - @jerome.ambroise_cab User ID: 5021411
- When everything is finished, please send an e-mail to jerome.ambroise@clickandboat.com

Good luck and see you soon ;)
